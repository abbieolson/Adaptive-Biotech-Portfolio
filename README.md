## Recent Projects
Collection of projects from my externship at Adaptive Biotechnologies.

*Note: Variables have been changed and references to company IP have been omitted.*

To satisfy the internship component of my MS in Bioinformatics from the University of Oregon, I have been working as an extern with Adaptive's Computational Biology group since March 2020. I work mainly with the Statistics and Algorithms subgroup and have collaborated on a number of proprietary projects in various computational disciplines (from machine learning to tool development). While much of the work I do is considered sensitive intellectual property, the following code snippets have been deemed acceptable for sharing.

Check out Adaptive's [website](https://www.adaptivebiotech.com/) for more info on the company.

[**Project 1:]**(https://github.com/abbieolson/Recent-Projects/Project_1/README.md/) Deployed machine learning methods to analyze aspects of one of Adaptive's [core technologies](https://www.clonoseq.com/) that may affect accuracy.

[**Project 2:]** Designed and examined DNA probes (strings) with fuzzy matching and simulations.

[**Project 3:]** Developed a Python tool for laboratory researchers to easily merge and migrate inconsistent Excel data.
