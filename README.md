To satisfy the internship component of my MS in Bioinformatics from the University of Oregon, I have been working as an extern with Adaptive's Computational Biology group since March 2020. I work mainly with the Statistics and Algorithms subgroup and have collaborated on a number of proprietary projects in various computational disciplines (from machine learning to tool development). While much of the work I do is considered sensitive intellectual property, the following code snippets have been deemed acceptable for sharing.

* [Project 1:](/Project_1/README.md) Deployed machine learning methods to analyze aspects of one of Adaptive's [core technologies](https://www.clonoseq.com/) that may have an effect on accuracy.
* [Project 2:](/Project_2/README.md) Designed and examined DNA probes (strings) with fuzzy matching and simulations.
* [Project 3:](/Project_3/README.md) Developed a tool for laboratory researchers to easily merge and migrate inconsistent Excel data.
* [Term Papers:](/Externship_Term_Papers/README.md) See my term papers for technical information about some of my projects.
