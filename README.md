To satisfy the internship component of my MS in Bioinformatics from the University of Oregon, I have been working as an extern with Adaptive's Computational Biology group since March 2020. I work mainly with the Statistics and Algorithms subgroup and have collaborated on a number of proprietary projects in various computational disciplines (from machine learning to tool development). While much of the work I do is considered sensitive intellectual property, the following code snippets have been deemed acceptable for sharing. Thanks for stopping by!

Check out Adaptive's [website](https://www.adaptivebiotech.com/) for more info on the company.

Project 1: Deployed machine learning methods to analyze aspects of one of Adaptive's [core technologies](https://www.clonoseq.com/) that may affect its accuracy.
